### So what is drivers negligence insurance?

Simply put, drivers negligence insurance is specific to the staffing sector - namely the following;

1. Recruitment and Employment Business supplying temporary drivers,
2. Umbrella or Payroll Companies and the contractors they have,

Drivers Negligence in the most-part, is an extension to the Public Liability and its purpose in short - is to cover damage to vehicles, which has been caused by temporary workers whom have been supplied by the recruitment agency or applicable business.

The cover itself is not a RTA compliant policy (road-traffic-act) and as such, the owners of the vehicles being used by the temporary workers, should have sufficient motor fleet insurances.

The **purpose** of drivers negligence insurance, is primarily there to cover the "end-hirers" insurance policy (mainly damages that fall within the excess) so, there are limitations to the coverage provided and this should be checked, when obtaining insurance quotations.

### Limits and excesses

The limits applicable are usually stipulated by your client however, generally speaking it is usually £10,000 any one claim / any one event (depending on the insurer) but, lower limits like £5,000 or some higher, i.e. £20,000 or £25,000 are available via **some insurers** and, if this is required by your client (albeit uncommon).
